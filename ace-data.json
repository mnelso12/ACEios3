In a neighborhood that is notorious for high rates of crime and poverty, St. Philip Neri stands as a beacon of hope for the children and community that it serves. With nearly 100 percent Latino enrollment, it is one example of the many extraordinary urban Catholic schools that have found new life in serving the Latino community. <br /><br />The school’s success is due in no small part to the tireless efforts of its leadership—former principal, Mary McCoy, and current principal, Gary Asher. Both are graduates of the ACE Remick Leadership Program and have been instrumental in creating a culturally-responsive school environment and are well-equipped as educational and spiritual leaders to foster a vibrant school community.",

Over the last 10 years, more than 95% of its graduates who have applied to some of the top private high schools in Austin have been accepted. This can be attributed to CSSM's strong, holistic approach to curriculum, fostering the spiritual, academic, and social development of each student. Through a differentiated blended learning curriculum, CSSM enriches the student learning experience through teacher-student interaction, technology, and hands-on instruction.<br /><br /> In the summer of 2014, Principal Robert LeGros and a team from CSSM attended the Latino Enrollment Institute at the University of Notre Dame, seeking new ideas and strategies to reach out to the growing Latino population in their community.

As a result of her efforts, the school has seen a significant and continued increase in Latino enrollment in the past four years. <br /><br /> Sacred Heart School's enrollment growth truly began when Mrs. Camacho first spoke about the school at all of the parish Masses. Her \"speech,\" followed by a positive and inspiring endorsement of the school by the pastor, initiated a flood of inquiries that generated an enrollment increase of 50 new students by the start of the following school year. \"When we first took on this initiative,\" says Mrs. Camacho, \"it really gave our school new life...

Through the LEI, Maria and her staff learned that they were not alone in their present challenges, and even more importantly, were able to take away valuable new ideas, strategies, and hope from the other principals that they met who had successfully transformed--and indeed saved--their schools that at one time also faced imminent closure. <br /><br /> Maria and her staff returned to Salem that summer feeling that they had been given a mandate. They resolved to build a culture of success at St. Vincent de Paul and to promote the high-quality, Catholic education that they could offer. They began to reach out to the growing Latino population in their parish and surrounding community, and word began to spread about the good things that were happening at the school. After attending the LEI in the summer of 2012, St. Vincent de Paul was able to double their enrollment by the start of the school year, and more than triple their enrollment by the beginning of the next.",

It was her vision of what the school could become that allowed her to build a coalition of devoted teachers, staff members, parents, and the pastor, to revive the school community. Mary states that she was very clear from the beginning what the mission of the school was. She wanted to build upon the Church's tradition of serving the underserved, which meant being open to tuition negotiation to ensure that every child has the same opportunity to receive a quality Catholic education. Mary has been very intentional about truly getting to know the community that she serves, understanding the lives, joys, and challenges of St. Gertrude's families, and incorporating all of this into the school using the Salesian charism.

It is the only Catholic school serving five of the surrounding communities. In 2011, after numerous years of declining enrollment, the school was slated to close. That same year, Mary Flock was hired as the new principal and inherited a school with no books, 7 teachers, and only 42 students. And if the task of turning the school around were not daunting enough, she was given one year to make it happen. <br /><br /> Mary and her team rolled up their sleeves and got to work, and from day one, her focus was on building a community. Through a lot of hard work, creativity, and sheer will to see St. Gertrude School succeed, Mary and her team were able to increase their enrollment from 42 students to 110 in a single year. Following that year, in the summer of 2012, Mary and her team from St. Gertrude the Great attended the first Latino Enrollment Institute at Notre Dame to further build on the progress they had already made. Having successfully revived St. Gertrude School from the most bleak circumstances, Mary was invited to join the LEI Design Team as a mentor principal and has been serving ever since.",

St. Clement School has served the community of St. Bernard for over 160 years, but in more recent years was in danger of closing as enrollment began to decline. That all changed when Principal Jeff Eiser and his wife, Rosie, first came to the school in 2010. For Jeff, a former sheriff's deputy of 29 years, this is a second career. He and his wife, Rosie, saw it as an opportunity to minister together and change young lives through Catholic education. Rosie serves as the volunteer school librarian, but her role extends far beyond that, as she is the main point of contact for the school's Hispanic families. As a wife, mother, and native Spanish-speaker, she is able to identify with the families, speak with them in their native language, and forge strong relationships, which has borne fruit in those families going out and spreading the word about St. Clement. <br /><br /> While St. Clement School continues to be very diverse, it too has followed the same demographic growth trends as much of the nation. The number of Latino families in the parish and the surrounding community have grown at a much faster rate, which gave impetus to St. Clement sending a team to the Latino Enrollment Institute at the University of Notre Dame in the summer 2013. Today, St. Clement school's enrollment is the highest it has been in 20 years.",

Carmel School (OLMC), located in the coastal town of Asbury Park, New Jersey, is a pre-K-8 Catholic school with a long history of service to low-income, immigrant families. About ten years ago, OLMC served a primarily African-American and Haitian student population and enrollment had dropped so low that the school was in danger of closing. Since then, a major demographic shift has ensued. The school's population remains very culturally diverse, but in the past five years, the number of Latino children attending OLMC has increased tremendously. Many of the school's families live in economically challenged neighborhoods of Asbury Park, and nearly one hundred percent of student families qualify as low-income.<br /><br />In 2013, Sr. Jude Boyce, SSJ, Principal of OLMC, along with two members of her staff, attended the Latino Enrollment Institute at Notre Dame to learn new strategies to reach out to their growing Latino population. Today, the school is thriving and proudly serves a 70-percent Latino student population.",

The school serves the communities of two Catholic parishes in town, St. Francis de Sales and Our Lady of the Lake. When Principal Jo Jones first came to Corpus Christi in 2009, the school had been decreasing in enrollment for several years, which was largely due to two corporations leaving town, and a number of seats had simply remained empty. At that same time, Joanne recognized that there was a growing Latino population in the community and parents who weren't even aware that a Catholic education was an option for their children. She began speaking at Masses and meeting with parishioners, slowly becoming a familiar face within the community. Before long, families were inquiring about the school and showing up to take tours. <br /><br />In 2013, Corpus Christi participated in the Latino Enrollment Institute at Notre Dame to learn additional ways to make their growing Latino population feel more at home in their school, as well as new strategies to reach out to and engage more Latino families seeking a quality Catholic education for their children. Today, Corpus Christi's Latino enrollment is the highest it has ever been and serves as a shining example of how an astute, committed principal can truly transform a Catholic school.",

After years of declining enrollment, the school has been on an upswing and full of energy. Led by Principal Sr. Julie Kubasak, DC, who seeks to make Catholic education affordable and accessible to all who desire it, the school has experienced an incredible enrollment surge. It began several years ago when Sr. Julie arrived at the Sunday Spanish Mass at St. Vincent de Paul Parish, finding the church filled to capacity and overflowing into the courtyard. Sr. Julie realized that hundreds of Latino families regularly attended the Mass there, but the majority of them did not have their children in the school. In talking with the parents, she found that most of them didn't even know the school was there, despite the fact that they were standing right next to it. From that point on, Sr. Julie resolved to make SVdP School more visible in the community and a place in which Latino children could feel at home. The dramatic transformation that ensued led to several years of enrollment growth, surpassing 600 this year, and the school's first double-graded campus in over 20 years. <br/ ><br/ > Sr. Julie has served as a mentor principal for the Latino Enrollment Institute for the last three years, assisting other Catholic schools seeking new ideas and strategies to effectively reach out to and serve the Latino population.",

Word of mouth has also been largely responsible for bringing in a number of new families to the school, and this is supported through a parent leadership training program called Madrinas y Padrinos. In this program, faciliated by the school staff, parent leaders are groomed to become leaders within their community.",

Training parents in how to assist this growth and how to recognize the value of Catholic education has been key to sustaining and growing enrollment as well. Although parents didn't choose the school, at least initially, for its academic strengths, they have grown to acknowledge and pass the good word on to friends and family throughout the neighborhood. The State accountability system which grades schools on an A-F GPA scale based upon standardized testing achievement has helped the school prove and demonstrate the academic success of its students. In other words, there is a tangible result that students and their families can be proud of on a school-wide basis.",

St. Adalbert Church is exceptionally beautiful and has earned the distinction, albeit informal, \"The Cathedral of the West Side.\"<br /><br />The parish and school are situated in a high poverty neighborhood that has undergone a series of massive demographic transitions due to Latino immigration. Today, St. Adalbert community is proud to continue serving a Catholic immigrant population. Most students attending St. Adalbert Catholic School receive Indiana School Choice Scholarships, which are a tremendous help in defraying the cost of tuition for families.",

In the past, Latino outreach was done more sporadicly, but more recently, they have taken a more organized approach, thanks to a number of enthusiastic Latino families in the school community. Principal Scott Schmiesing says that \"the most powerful approach is to have a Latino parent of a St. Ambrose student share, both through presentations and, especially, within parents' social network, how the school has transformed their child.\" It has quickly become apparent that Latino families most value their children’s catechesis, a safe environment, academic excellence, and available tuition assistance.",
            "keys-to-success": "St. Ambrose has innovative curricula that attract the notice of many prospective parents. Families like the school's commitment to authentic Catholic catechesis. Parents want their children to know the Church's teachings and to encounter Jesus Christ during the school day. They can find this at St. Ambrose. Many parents, however, are just hearing about St. Ambrose, and the best connections are made personally, rather than through impersonal marketing. Through building relationships and sharing the opportunities and financial assistance that St. Ambrose has to offer, they have made progress in debunking the myth that a private Catholic school education is prohibitively expensive. To ensure that everyone has a stake in the school's ability to serve all who desire a Catholic education at St. Ambrose, they ask for school families' involvement in development efforts both to raise funds and build enrollment.",

The student body includes youth from parochial, public, and home school environments.<br /><br />Madison has a growing Latino population which is largely unaware of Catholic education resources. St. Ambrose Academy has initiated a \"Catholic School Advantage\" program, a coordinated Latino outreach effort aimed at increasing Latino enrollment by building relationships in the community, as well as offering low tuition rates and tuition assistance to remove any financial obstacles that may stand in the way of a family choosing a Catholic school. To make this happen, St. Ambrose Academy has a very active development office that works to cultivate a wide network of financial supporters and volunteers.",

Overall enrollment has remained relatively steady while the Hispanic population continues to increase. The future is filled with hope as the school looks forward to increased enrollment in the coming years as more Latino families become part of the St. Jude Catholic School community.",

Continued outreach to two nearby Hispanic parishes has proven the most effective way to form relationships with the Hispanic community and to encourage families to consider Catholic education. Strong academic, marketing, and tuition assistance support from the diocesan Catholic Schools Office has also made recruiting efforts successful.",
            "keys-to-success": "St. Jude operates on a just tuition model in order to accommodate, as best they can, all families that desire a Catholic education for their children. They have identified a number of Hispanic mothers (Madrinas) who work to promote the school throughout the Hispanic community. School board members are also working to create a scholarship fund, identifying and approaching businesses, alumni, and friends to donate annual scholarships. Most of St. Jude’s marketing and registration information is available in both Spanish and English, and one of the Dominican Sisters who is fluent in Spanish often speaks at nearby Hispanic parishes. Sr. Cecilia Joseph and her staff have been very intentional about creating a welcoming environment for prospective Latino families, offering tours of the school in Spanish. The school environment also reflects this as Our Lady of Guadalupe is displayed prominently in the school. They also create an altar for Día de los Muertos, host an annual tamale sale, and regularly say the rosary in both Spanish and English as a school.",

Run by the Dominican Sisters of St. Cecilia (Nashville, TN), St. Jude is located in the greater Chicagoland area in Joliet, IL. Like many cities, Joliet’s demographics have changed in the past decade, with the Latino population increasing dramatically. St. Jude is a melting pot where families from various ethnic backgrounds converge. Students come from blue-collar families whose hard-working parents make many sacrifices to provide a Catholic education for their children and often work two to three jobs to provide for their family. Many families receive tuition assistance through the Diocese of Joliet, as well as tuition assistance from the parish, which makes a Catholic education possible.<br /><br /> \"At St. Jude, Jesus Christ is the reason we exist,\" says Sr. Cecilia Joseph, the school’s principal. \"He is the source of all that we do and the goal that directs all our daily actions. We strive to be zealous, joyful, faithful, and humble bearers of the Gospel message.\" The formation of the whole child, spiritually, academically, socially, and morally, is the first priority at St. Jude. The school provides an excellent academic and religious education so that its students can go on to make a positive contribution to the Church, their community, the country, and the world.",

In 1907 the Sisters of the Holy Names responded to the request of Bishop Thomas Conaty and the school was opened with grades one through eight. In 1992, the Salesian Sisters replaced the Sisters of Holy Names. At that time, Sr. Amparo Uribe, FMA assumed the role of principal and concentrated on increasing enrollment in the school. With the help of the community, as well as other contributors, St. Mary's began to see a significant increase in its enrollment. <br /><br />Over the years, the demographics of the area have changed from a middle-class Anglo population to a lower-income Hispanic population. The student population is 97 percent Hispanic, and given the socioeconomic landscape of the neighborhood surrounding the school, many families are unable to pay for their children's education. Today, St. Mary's principal, Sr. Anna Bui, FMA, has continuously met this challenge, fostering a community of faith and family spirit among her faculty, staff, students, parents, and friends. Under her leadership, the school was renovated in 2009 with the help of several generous foundations and charitable institutions.",

The school was founded in 1957 and was originally staffed by the Sisters of a Canadian Congregation, the Daughters of Jesus. OLFCS began with grades one through three and added a grade each year until the school served students through grade eight.<br /><br />Currently, OLFCS, along with several other schools in the Diocese of Stockton, are turning their attention to the growing needs of the area's Latino population. Beginning in the Fall of 2014, the Alliance for Catholic Education formed a partnership with Diocese of Stockton to provide a range of support services, including staff development, blended learning, and an onsite field consultant to assist schools in developing culturally-responsive recruitment and marketing plans in an effort to attach more Latino families.

Corpus Christi prides itself in its strong, family-like community, due in large part to the school’s long-standing and award-winning principal, Mrs. Kathleen Murphy.

Latino students account for nearly 96 percent of the total enrollment.",
            "recruitment-marketing": "With its strong reputation in the community, word of mouth serves as the most powerful recruiting tool for St. Rose of Lima. The school’s leadership has been very intentional about increasing enrollment. They looked closely at the student population to determine how they could best serve their families, which culminated in the adoption of the Expeditionary Learning model. This model of teaching and learning, which empowers students to be leaders by placing them at the center of the educational experience, has been a major selling point in marketing the school. The administration notes, however, that in recruiting at feeder parishes, the most effective message has been a simple one  - “We want to build strong relationships with you in order to best serve the needs of the children in our community.”",
            "keys-to-success": "There is arguably no factor more critical to the vibrancy of a Catholic school than the talent and disposition of its leadership. St. Rose of Lima serves as the perfect example of this as both the pastor and principal have been the most important drivers for change. The school and parish leadership possess a fundamental understanding that building relationships with other pastors, donors, and the wider community is key to building a strong school. Similarly, the faculty and staff are professionals with a deeply held sense of mission and a desire to build community and grow the St. Rose of Lima family. In 2010, St. Rose of Lima became the first Catholic Expeditionary School in the country. This partnership with Expeditionary Learning propelled St. Rose to implement an innovative approach to education, leading to an impressive 95-percent high school graduation rate.",

            "about-content": "For 60 years, St. Rose of Lima Catholic Academy has been working small miracles in a low-income, predominantly Latino neighborhood of southwest Denver. Operating within a limited budget, the school has given children, many of whom society has labeled as ‘disadvantaged’ or ‘at-risk,’ the opportunity to discover their God-given potential, develop a deep love for learning, and a desire to achieve excellence as scholars and as young men and women of upstanding moral character. When Jeannie Courchene became Principal of St. Rose of Lima in 1999, the school was in physical disrepair and in dire need of renovations. Mrs. Courchene and the pastor began the long road to “cleaning up” the school, while also brainstorming ways to attract more students. They developed a marketing brochure that proclaimed,  “We’ve turned old lumber into computer tables, cardboard boxes into window shades, and hundreds of at-risk children into high school graduates. It’s our modest attempt to follow a man who turned a few loaves and fishes into a meal for thousands.” These words capture the vibrant purpose and achievement of the students, parents, teachers, and leadership embodied by this Catholic elementary school.<br /><br />Within eight years of Mrs. Courchene at the helm, enrollment had exceeded 200 for the first time in 20 years. Through her efforts to build relationships in the community and establish a development board to help stabilize enrollment and put the school in a more viable financial position, St. Rose of Lima was able to raise $1.2 million to build a new gym, library, and preschool in 2007. With the infrastructure and enrollment necessary to become a model of educational excellence, St. Rose of Lima has continued to grow, serving as a true “witness to the possible.” Mrs. Courchene now serves as a mentor principal with ACE’s Latino Enrollment Institute, helping other schools develop marketing strategies and school culture interventions to attract and serve Latino families more effectively. The school remains in great hands in current principal, Elias Moo, a graduate of the ACE Teaching Fellows program.",

The school now seeks out bilingual individuals to join the staff and faculty who understand and represent the community that the school serves. They also frequently speak at Spanish Masses within the parish, and all marketing materials are now bilingual. Recognizing how powerful word-of-mouth can be in attracting new families to the school, they also actively encourage existing families to speak to their friends and family about the benefits of a Catholic education and recommend St. Louis the King as an option. The school has also begun offering financial aid workshops to help families apply for scholarships, which has helped change the perception that many Latino families have of a Catholic education being unattainable because of the cost.",

Rather than fighting the tide, as we had done for several years, we chose to embrace the opportunity that God has placed before us.” This has led to a very intentional approach to school culture in which all events are now planned with the traditions and cultural practices of the school’s families in mind. They have made great strides in incorporating more elements of Latino culture into the campus, including a new prayer garden centered around a recently-painted mural of Our Lady of Guadalupe.",

The school has recently undergone a significant demographic shift, moving from a predominantly middle-class, Caucasian student population to one that is primarily lower-income and Latino. Since the 2009-10 school year alone, the percentage of Hispanic students has increased from 58 to 75 percent, while the percentage of students qualifying for the free and reduced lunch program has grown from 51 to 83 percent.<br /><br />Enrollment figures have fluctuated significantly over the past six years as well. St. Louis the King School ended the 2009-10 school year with 248 students, but by the start of the 2012 school year, that number had dropped to 148. This dramatic decrease in enrollment, along with the recognition of St. Louis the King’s changing community and the needs of many underserved Latino families, gave impetus to the school’s Latino outreach efforts. In the summer of 2014, Principal Charlene Krushinsky and two members of her staff attended the Latino Enrollment Institute at the University of Notre Dame. Their efforts to market the school more effectively within the Latino community since then have truly paid off, as evidenced by their impressive enrollment growth.",

This new educational model was the first collaboration of its kind in the United States. A new governing structure was established to include representatives from the parish, the archdiocese, Boston College, and the greater Boston community.

Many members of the staff and faculty also have roots in this community, which has aided in recruitment as well. Resurrection has responded to the changing demographics in their school and in the wider community by honoring and celebrating the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds that the students and their families bring to the school. By incorporating the unique cultural traditions of their students into the life of the school, and by emphasizing familial engagement as an integral part of that, Resurrection has built a strong community that continues to grow and in which its students thrive.",

            "about-content": "Resurrection School is a PreK3-6 Catholic elementary school located in a predominantly low-income neighborhood of Memphis known as Hickory Hill, opened in 2005 and is the newest of the Jubilee Model schools in the Diocese of Memphis. The Jubilee Catholic Schools Network is comprised of previously closed urban Catholic schools that were reopened to serve those with the greatest need—the children living in Memphis’ urban neighborhoods. In recent years, the demographics in this area have begun to shift and many schools are seeing growing numbers of Latino families. And at Resurrection, unlike many of the other schools in the Jubilee network, there is also a large Catholic population.<br /><br />As a Jubilee Model school, Resurrection is able to offer need-based tuition scholarships to families who desire an excellent school experience for their children and wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford it. Catholic identity is at the core of Resurrection School’s mission, and it is this shared faith that draws many families to the school. At the same time, the school prides itself on the diversity of its student body, which is honored and celebrated in special events throughout the year, such as Dia de los Muertos, las Posadas, and Black History Month. And since an increasing number of the school’s students come from homes in which English is not the first language, the school employs bilingual teachers in the younger grades and in the front office, and also offers ESL classes for Kindergarten through 6th grade. For these reasons, among many others, Resurrection School is a model of cultural responsiveness, consequently seeing both their overall and Latino enrollment grow.",

The school was founded by the Sisters of the Holy Names. During the Spanish-American War, they tended the wounded while the school was used by the armed forces as a hospital for over eight-hundred American soldiers. In 1926, the parish had the first bilingual Spanish priest in West Tampa and two years later, the Salesian Sisters assumed the administration of the school. It was at this time that the school and parish were renamed St. Joseph. For twenty-one years, an abandoned cigar factory served as the kindergarten classroom, the parish hall, a community center, and the residence of the Salesian Sisters. In July 2011, Mrs. Brenda Budd was welcomed into the St. Joseph Catholic School community as the first lay principal.

Soon after, the neighborhoods changed significantly and those Catholic families, along with subsequent generations, have moved east and south of Fort Smith. In the 70s and 80s, Fort Chaffee Army Base, located east of Fort Smith, was the relocation site for refugees from Vietnam and Laos, many of whom were Catholic and attended Immaculate Conception. Since the early 2000s, Arkansas has experienced, similar to many places throughout the U.S., an influx of Latino families, particularly from Mexico. For about a decade, the school’s enrollment dropped off considerably, despite the growing number of Latino families, but in the past few years, they have begun to see an increasing presence of Latino families within the school. Immaculate Conception was the first Catholic school in Arkansas to be recognized as a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence in 2013, and the first elementary school in the region, public or private, to receive this recognition.",

Similar to the Cristo Rey model, students in grades 9-12 go to work with a community corporate or non-profit business partner once a week that allows them to connect their educational experience to real world professional experience.<br /><br />The school has been a key part of the Memphis educational system since 1945 and has played a vital role in the integration of Memphis schools, both in terms of race and gender. Memphis Catholic’s mission statement is at the core of everything the school does: \"We prepare servant leaders through a challenging Christ-centered education in mind, heart, body, and heart.\"<br /><br />Memphis Catholic prides itself on the diversity of its students, who come from over 33 zip codes in the Memphis metropolitan area and 11 different countries. Though the school is a Catholic school, the majority of its students are non-Catholic. The student body resembles the demographic makeup of the city of Memphis, with the majority of students being African-American (57%), followed by Latinos (25%), African (7%), Caucasian (6%), and multi-racial (5%). Furthermore, many of the school’s families are either one-parent families, encounter significant financial hardship, or both.",

            "recruitment-marketing": "Catholic Central’s increase in Latino enrollment is the result of a deliberate effort to reach out to families in predominantly Latino parishes. The school distributes marketing materials in both Spanish and English, and the entire staff has made a concerted effort to be more intimately involved in the recruitment of Latino families. They travel to the local Catholic elementary school and assist with financial aid forms, present informational meetings in Spanish, and have asked for current Latino high school families to come and speak to prospective families about their experiences at Catholic Central. The Admissions Director is bilingual and has developed personal relationships with Latino families so that they can address all concerns regarding their children. A primary concern for Latino families is affordability, and Catholic Central has made it a priority to ensure that the school is accessible to all families, regardless of socioeconomic status. The Guidance Director is also bilingual and is able to make course selection and college planning meetings productive for many families that are sending their first family member to college. The school believes the most effective message has been one of inclusion and the willingness to embrace cultural differences while maintaining its academic expectations and Catholic identity.",

The school has highlighted the success of Latino students not only to the Latino community but to the community at large, including its stakeholders and donors. The success of the school’s Latino students has been an important driver for increased donations, which in turn has benefited the community as a whole. Beyond monetary concerns, Latino families face many hurdles when applying to college. Since the adoption of the school’s college counseling mode, the  counselors have been very successful in assisting families through the application process, sending transcripts, letters of recommendation, and financial aid application. Catholic Central is committed to supporting all of our families from freshman year to graduation and beyond.",

St. Anne is uniquely able to provide children a Catholic education from preschool through senior year – the first school in the diocese to offer this option – after becoming a K3-12 school in 2014. With the addition of high school, enrollment has grown from an average of 265 students in 2012 to over 300 students in grades K3-10 this year.

The K3-12 model has proven successful and has been an effective recruiting tool, especially for families wanting a Catholic Education from start to finish.<br /><br />While Rock Hill and its surrounding areas have not historically had a strong Catholic presence, this has been changing in recent years, with the Vietnamese and Hispanic populations contributing to much of this growth. St. Anne’s student body is currently made up of 17 percent minorities, but there is a growing Latino presence in the parish community.

St. Stephen School is an outgrowth of St. Stephen Catholic Church, which had been serving the Glenwood Springs community since 1885. In 1981, Fr. Joseph Leberer, with the help of two sisters of the order of St. Joseph and a group of committed parents who were devoted to giving the children of the Roaring Fork Valley a Christ-centered education, founded St. Stephen Catholic School. Today, the school has grown to serve not only the children of St. Stephen Parish and Glenwood Springs, but the children of surrounding towns and parishes as well.<br /><br />Currently, St. Stephen Parish is 65-70 percent Latino, and two of the five masses offered each weekend are in Spanish. The parish has also recently begun offering bilingual sacramental masses and has combined their religious education programs to become one bilingual program. The clear demographic shift taking place gave impetus to the school and parish community’s efforts to better reach out to and serve the growing Latino population.

Even though in most cases I knew what my answer was going to be to the family sitting across from me - ‘yes, you can come here’ - I committed to sitting down with parents and students to listen to their stories, understand where they were coming from, and acknowledge that their needs and desires were important.\" It was through the simple acts of listening, being present to families, and instituting small changes that the school began to experience a turnaround. Additionally, through internet marketing efforts, St. Andrew’s visibility in the community has increased and has helped establish them as the premier Catholic school in the area.",
            "keys-to-success": "St. Andrew School represents an ideal witness to the possible with regards to the vitality and growth that can result from doing the little things right. After experiencing such a sharp decline in enrollment, the new leadership was committed to rebuilding damaged relationships and establishing new ones within the community, which has played a key role in the school’s enrollment growth. Jefferies also notes that the LEI was eye-opening in that it validated so many of the things that they had begun doing at St. Andrew and it empowered them to take those practices to the next level. Once such practice is the inclusion of culturally responsive imagery in the school’s entryway, which inspired him to place images of Our Lady of Guadalupe in every room throughout the entire building. Equally important to the positive changes taking place at St. Andrew is the support of the pastor, Fr. Marco. A native of El Salvador and an English language learner himself, Fr. Marco understands the needs of many of the school’s Latino families and routinely speaks from the pulpit with authority and conviction about the value of a Catholic education. On any given day, Fr. Marco is likely to be found in the school hallways, visiting and sometimes teaching classes, or in his office, which is conveniently located right next to Mr. Jefferies. Because of this relationship, the parish and school have really come to be seen as the same entity with a common mission.",

            "about-content": "Built in 2008 out of the generosity of the ALSAM Foundation, St. Andrew is the newest Catholic school in the Diocese of Salt Lake City. The school serves a diverse student body in grades pre-K through 8 and provides a holistic STREAM education to meet the needs of students from a variety of social, economic, ethnic, racial, and religious backgrounds. While St. Andrew operated at or just near capacity for a number of years, enrollment began to dip at an alarming rate in 2013. Enrollment had dropped by more than 35 percent over the previous 18 months, and in July of 2014, new principal, Patrick Jefferies, arrived with a mandate and a plan to turn the school around.<br /><br />Although Jefferies came to St. Andrew with a strong background in educational leadership and school improvement work, he didn’t necessarily set out to make sweeping changes. For the most part, he had inherited a school with a good foundation upon which to build. Academically, the school was relatively strong and the majority of the faculty and staff were well-qualified and supported his vision for the school. Jefferies notes that what the community really needed was to feel a sense of ownership in the school, to know that they belong there at St. Andrew, and that the leadership is committed to doing whatever it takes to make that possible. In the summer of 2015, Jefferies and a team from St. Andrew attended the <a target='_blank' href='https://ace.nd.edu/catholic-school-advantage/latino-enrollment-institute'>Latino Enrollment Institute</a> at the University of Notre Dame. Upon returning, their efforts certainly paid off, as they have seen a significant increase in the number of Latino families enrolling their children at St. Andrew School.",
